I just released `dinject` v1.2 with a bunch of new features. Let's go!

<!--more-->

## What's "dinject"?

For any folks who aren't familiar, `dinject` is a CLI app for executing code blocks in Markdown documents and injecting the responses.

While it currently only supports Python and Bash blocks, the package is extensible if there's interest (or, as-and-when I need more languages).

Basically, `dinject` helps you to:

- document your projects
- ensure code samples are valid
- ensure example responses are correct

For example, say you have a Markdown document:

~~~markdown
To print "hello world", run:

```python
print("hello world")
```
~~~

To embed the code's result in the document, add a `dinject` tag:

~~~markdown
To print "hello world", run:

```python
print("hello world")
```

<!--dinject-->
~~~

...then run `dinject`:

```bash
dinject content/2021-11-14-dinject-1.2.0.md
```

_Et voil√†,_ your Markdown document has been updated to include the execution result:

~~~markdown
To print "hello world", run:

```python
print("hello world")
```

<!--dinject as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
hello world
```

<!--dinject range=end-->
~~~

## What's new in 1.2?

First, **tilde fences**. v1.0 supported only backtick fences, but v1.2 uses my new `mdcode`[^mdcode] parser which adds support for tilde fences:

[^mdcode]: ["mdcode", unbuild.blog](https://unbuild.blog/tags/mdcode)

```markdown
~~~python
print("dinject v1.2 will recognise this!")
~~~

<!--dinject-->
```

Second, **the "dinject" tag keyword is now configurable**. This won't affect users at all, but allows other applications and packages to "white label" `dinject`.

In v1.0, the `inject()` method accepted only a reader (for reading the source Markdown) and writer (for writing the updated Markdown). Now the method has an optional `parser` argument which allows the keyword to be customised:

```python
from dinject import inject, Parser

inject(
    parser=Parser(
        # This injector will recognise "<!--foo-->"
        # tags in the source document:
        keyword="foo",
    ),
    reader=reader,
    writer=writer,
)
```

Third, the new `Parser` allows the host code to **override a document's attribute values**.

Say, for example, you wanted a document's execution results to be injected as HTML even if the document's markup requested Markdown:

```python
from dinject import inject, Content, Parser, ParserOptions

inject(
    parser=Parser(
        # This injector will always inject
        # results as HTML, even for
        # "<!--dinject as=markdown-->" tags:
        options=ParserOptions(
            force_content=Content.HTML,
        ),
    ),
    reader=reader,
    writer=writer,
)
```

Fourth and finally, a document can **request tilde fencing** (versus the backtick default) by adding a `fence=tildes` attribute. This is handy for when the code execution will itself return a Markdown fragment that would conflict with the document's markup:

```python
print("```python")
print("# This would've been painful in v1.0!")
print("```")
# Inject via: <!--dinject fence=tildes-->
```

<!--dinject as=markdown fence=tildes host=shell range=start-->

~~~text
```python
# This would've been painful in v1.0!
```
~~~

<!--dinject range=end-->

## 1.2.0

`dinject` can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dinject
```

...or upgraded to v1.2 with:

```bash
pip install dinject --upgrade
```

The project is online with full documentation at [github.com/cariad/dinject](https://github.com/cariad/dinject) under the MIT licence.

Have fun!
