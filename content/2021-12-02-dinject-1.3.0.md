I just released Dinject 1.3 and -- I've got to be honest -- this is a quick and boring one.

<!--more-->

Just two changes this time:

1. Dinject now uses Comprehemd[^comprehemd] to parse Markdown.
1. If a script fails, `stderr` rather than `stdout` is now injected.

## 1.3.0

As always, Dinject can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install dinject
```

The package is fully documented at [cariad.github.io/dinject](https://cariad.github.io/dinject) and released under the MIT licence at [github.com/cariad/dinject](https://github.com/cariad/dinject).

Have fun!
