title: stormynight.app is now antagonist.app
---

I'm a freelance developer by trade, but I spent a chunk of this year booting-up my own business; a creative writing app named **stormynight.app**.

Y'know, as in, _"It was a dark and stormy night."_

Hah. I have a singular wit.

But as much as I need to get my head down and focus on building the damned thing, I can't sit with that name. Not any more. So I went back to the mood boards today, and now I'm building **antagonist.app**.

What's wrong with **stormynight.app**, then?

## More extreme weather events are killing more people

On December 10th 2021, tornadoes swept through Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee.[^study]

At the time of writing, at least 92 people are confirmed dead.[^confirmed] 14 of those people were sacrificed[^sacrificed] by candle factory and Amazon warehouse managers who wouldn't let them leave work and escape to safety.

And it's only going to get worse.

I mean, sure -- _capitalism_ -- but extreme weather too.

Let me be clear: there's no scientific consensus on whether or not human-caused climate change caused these tornados, or if human-caused climate change will lead to more frequent or more devastating tornadoes in the future.

But extreme weather events caused by human-led climate change _are_ killing people. And they _are_ getting worse.

A warming climate creates more killer heatwaves and wildfires[^fires]. Our atmosphere holds 7% more water for every 1°C it warms, which leads to heavier rainfall and flash flooding.[^degree] Rising sea levels put coastal defences under increasing pressure, until even a storm moderate by today's standards could wreak devastation.[^coastal]

## Thresholds

I was working on Stormy Night's landing page today.

Specifically, I was working on this headline:

> You love readers who reach for a book in a storm.
>
> We love authors who reach for their laptop.

It unsettled me. I couldn't make the name _Stormy Night_ work with any heading I threw at it. It took me the entire afternoon to figure out why.

I know not everyone will feel the same way, and I'm not trying to convince anyone that they should. But this breached my personal comfort threshold.

The fact is, I can't romanticise storms on a planet where year on year, more and more folks are going to be unemployed, homeless, starved, or just straight-out killed by them.

Or, if you need it, here's the capitalist argument: It's more profitable for me to spend my time building software than dealing with the fallout of my brand being associated with month-by-month deaths for the foreseeable future. It just makes business sense to dodge the problem altogether.

I know folks are going to call me ridiculous. I know folks are going to say _people die all the time_ and _not everything is offensive_. To those people, I preemptively say: _You're correct. 100%. Absolutely._

**This is just my threshold, man.**
