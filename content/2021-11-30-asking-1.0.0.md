Every Python script I write either interacts with local files or the cloud, or a bit of both.

For the first time in maybe _years_, I recently found myself needing to write a script that builds a configuration file by prompting the user to discuss their wants and desires.

I thought it was an interesting enough challenge to branch off into a new project, and so I just released **Asking**: a Python package for asking questions and getting answers!

<!--more-->

## In a nutshell

Basically, Asking works by reading a YAML script -- which contains questions and branches -- and populating a dictionary with the user's answers.

An example of a simple script would be:

```yaml
start:
  - ask:
      question: Name?
      key: name
      branches:
        - response: "^.+$"
          then:
            - stop: true
```

This script describes a single **stage** (more on those later) which asks the user for their name.

In this case, there's only one branching decision to make, and it describes a `response` regular expression that matches any string. So, whatever the user enters, it will be recorded in the `name` key of the responses dictionary then the script will stop, sending `True` back to the host application.

Asking comes with a `demo()` function for non-interactive demonstrations:

```python
from asking import demo

script = """
start:
  - ask:
      question: Name?
      key: name
      branches:
        - response: "^.+$"
          then:
            - stop: true
"""

# demo() runs non-interactively with preset directions
# and is intended for demonstrating only. See the usage
# documentation for implementation guidance.

demo(script, directions={"name": "Bobby Pringles"})
```

<!--dinject as=html fence=backticks host=terminal range=start-->

<style type="text/css">.weight-heavy { font-weight: bold; } .calligraphy-italic { font-style: italic; }</style><pre class="nohighlight thtml"><code class="thtml-code"><span class="weight-heavy">Name?</span><br />: <span class="calligraphy-italic">Bobby Pringles</span><br /><br />Stop reason: True<br />Responses:<br />{<br />  "name": "Bobby Pringles"<br />}<br /></code></pre>

<!--dinject range=end-->

A more complex script would contain multiple stages. Check this one out:

```yaml
start:
  - ask:
      question: Cake?
      key: cake
      branches:
        - response: [y, ""]
          then:
            - goto: cake
        - response: n
          then:
            - goto: tea

cake:
  - ask:
      question: Which cake?
      key: which_cake
      branches:
        - response: "^.+$"
          then:
            - goto: tea

tea:
  - ask:
      question: Tea?
      key: tea
      branches:
        - response: [y, ""]
          then:
            - goto: final
        - response: n
          then:
            - goto: final

final:
  - text: Thank you for your order!
  - stop: true
```

The script starts at `start` and asks the user if they want any cake. This time, the branch responses are multiple choice strings, with the "y" branch being the default by virtue of an empty response being accepted.

If the user _does_ want cake then they're asked which one. If they don't want cake, or after answering which cake they want, they're asked if they want tea. Either way, the script ends with a thank-you message then stops successfully.

For example:

```python
from asking import demo

script = """
start:
  - ask:
      question: Cake?
      key: cake
      branches:
        - response: [y, ""]
          then:
            - goto: cake
        - response: n
          then:
            - goto: tea

cake:
  - ask:
      question: Which cake?
      key: which_cake
      branches:
        - response: "^.+$"
          then:
            - goto: tea

tea:
  - ask:
      question: Tea?
      key: tea
      branches:
        - response: [y, ""]
          then:
            - goto: final
        - response: n
          then:
            - goto: final

final:
  - text: Thank you for your order!
  - stop: true
"""

# demo() runs non-interactively with preset directions and
# is intended for demonstrating only. See the usage
# documentation for implementation guidance.

demo(
    script,
    directions={
        "cake": "",
        "which_cake": "Battenberg",
        "tea": "",
    },
)
```
