I just released Cline 1.2, and it looks like I forgot to mention that 1.1 came out last week.

So here's everything new!

<!--more-->

## Cline 1.1

Cline 1.1 added support for a default value in `CommandLineArguments.get_string()`.

Previously, `get_string()` would always raise `CannotMakeArguments` if the argument wasn't set, but that sucked if the argument was legitimately optional.

So now you can pass in an optional default value. If the argument doesn't exist but you passed a default, you get the default back. If the argument doesn't exist and you didn't pass a default, `CannotMakeArguments` is raised.

## Cline 1.2

Alongside the existing `get_bool()`, `get_integer()` and `get_string()` functions, Cline 1.2 adds `get_list()`.

To use this, create an `ArgumentParser` argument with `action="append"`:

```python
parser.add_argument("--tag", action="append")
```

This lets you run your application with repeating arguments, like:

```bash
foo --tag alpha --tag beta
```

To read the list of values, call the new `get_list()` function:

```python
def make_args(cls, args: CommandLineArguments) -> Foo:
    tags = args.get_list("tag", []))
    # tags == ["alpha", "beta"]
```

## 1.2.0

As always, Cline can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install cline
```

The code is released under the MIT licence at [github.com/cariad/cline](https://github.com/cariad/cline), and the package is documented at [cariad.github.io/cline](https://cariad.github.io/cline).

Have fun!
