Okay, I grant you, parsing Markdown documents is a niche hobby.

Specifically, earlier this month, I found myself with two projects with their own unique implementations for parsing code blocks in Markdown documents.

Well, why write that code twice when I could package and release it once?

And so here's `mdcode`: a Python package for parsing code blocks in Markdown documents.

## Usage

First, install `mdcode` via `pip`:

```bash
pip install mdcode
```

To yield all the code blocks in a file -- say, one of my previous blog posts[^stackwhy] -- I only need to open the file then pass it to `get_blocks()`:

[^stackwhy]: ["stackwhy 1.0.1", githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cariad/unbuild.blog/main/content/2021-11-01-stackwhy-1.0.1.md)

```python
from mdcode import get_blocks

path = "content/2021-11-01-stackwhy-1.0.1.md"

with open(path, "r") as f:
    for block in get_blocks(f):
        print(block)
```

<!--dinject as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
bash block with 1 line detected with BackticksPattern at line 23 for 3 lines
bash block with 1 line detected with BackticksPattern at line 29 for 3 lines
python block with 6 lines detected with BackticksPattern at line 47 for 8 lines
```

<!--dinject range=end-->

The `ReadBlock` instances yielded by `get_blocks()` have a few properties for interrogating the details:

- `lang` gets the block's language
- `lines` gets the lines of code
- `source_index` gets the line number of the source document at which the block starts
- `source_length` gets the number of lines this block accommodates in the source document

The `render()` method renders the code block to a string writer. This is probably most useful for changing the fencing style when you need to embed a code sample inside another code block:

```python
from mdcode import get_blocks, Fence
from sys import stdout

body = """```yaml
foo: bar
```"""

block = next(get_blocks(body))
block.render(stdout, fence=Fence.TILDES)
```

<!--dinject as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
~~~yaml
foo: bar
~~~
```

<!--dinject range=end-->

You can also call `render_source()` to render the code block exactly as it was read:

```python
from mdcode import get_blocks, Fence
from sys import stdout

body = """# Indented demo

Here's some code:

    print("hello world")

It's very happy code.
"""

block = next(get_blocks(body))
block.render_source(stdout)
```

<!--dinject as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
    print("hello world")
```

<!--dinject range=end-->

## 1.0.0

Have fun!
