Have you ever wanted to pipe `stdout` into a pretty HTML document? With all the ANSI escape codes recognised and styled?

Maybe it's just me, but that's why I built `thtml`.

<!--more-->

## CLI example

The most basic way to use `thtml` is to pipe text into it:

```bash
echo "Hello, world!" | thtml
```

That'll emit an HTML document to `stdout` for you to redirect into a file or pipe into something else[^pup]:

[^pup]: [pup, a command line tool for processing HTML](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup)

```bash
echo "Hello, world!" | thtml > hello.html
echo "Hello, world!" | thtml | pup
```

If you want to open the HTML directly in your default browser, include the `--open` flag:

```bash
echo "Hello, world!" | thtml --open
```

Handy for keeping documentation open on the side of your terminal!

## Styling

Naturally, `thtml` supports ANSI escape formatting courtesy of [ansiscape]({{< ref "2021-10-06-ansiscape-1.0.0.md" >}}). `ansiscape --example` emits a ton of sample ANSI escape codes, and can be rendered to your default browser with:

```bash
ansiscape --example | thtml --open
```

If you need to pipe an app that omits styling when piped then -- courtesy of [naughtty]({{< ref "2021-10-07-naughtty-1.0.0.md" >}}) -- you can pass the app into `thtml` as an argument:

```bash
pipenv --help | thtml --open  # omits styling
thtml --open pipenv --help    # emits styling
```

## Themes

As well as the default style, `thtml` supports an extended theme called `google-fonts` which imports fonts from Google Fonts:

```bash
ansiscape --example | thtml --open --theme google-fonts
```

This enables the alternative fonts and blackletter styling, but you might not be keen on pinging Google behind the scenes, hence you must opt-into that styling.

There's also a `plain` theme if the default is too jarring for you:

```bash
ansiscape --example | thtml --open --theme plain
```

And finally, you can build your own entirely custom theme if you have the patience to grok the documentation[^custom-theme] and build a YAML file.

[^custom-theme]: [thtml, "Custom theming"](https://thtml.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/custom-themes/)

## 1.0.1

You can install `thtml` via `pip` with:

```bash
pip install thtml
```

All the code, including the theme YAML files for reference, is available at [github.com/cariad/thtml](https://github.com/cariad/thtml) under the MIT licence. And the full documentation is online at [thtml.readthedocs.io](https://thtml.readthedocs.io).

Have fun!
