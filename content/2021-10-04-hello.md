**Hello!** I'm Cariad Eccleston, and welcome to `unbuild.blog`!

I'm an independent/freelance software engineer and, frankly, this is a blog for self-promotion of my projects and other humanitarian/technological affairs I care about.

I'm [@cariad](https://github.com/cariad) on GitHub. Email me at [cariad@cariad.earth](mailto:cariad@cariad.earth). I aggressively report abuse, so if you want to disagree with me discourteously then retort on your own blog.

Epic ‚ù§Ô∏è to [dracula/pygments](https://github.com/dracula/pygments/) for the beautiful code colouring.
